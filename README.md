X-UI Metrics Exporter is a simple tool designed to collect and export metrics from the [Original X-UI Web Panel](https://github.com/alireza0/x-ui). This exporter provides some monitoring capabilities for various aspects of your X-UI, including node status, traffic flow, system performance, and user activity, making all data readily available for integration with the Prometheus monitoring system.

This is the fork of [3X-UI Metrics Exporter](github.com/hteppl/3x-ui-exporter) which is made by [hteppl](github.com/hteppl). It was moddified to support the legacy panel versions.

## Features

- **Online Monitoring**: Tracks the number of online users across your X-UI instance.
- **Traffic Metrics**: Monitors total uploaded and downloaded bytes per client or inbound.
- **X-UI Monitoring**: Provides detailed XRay version information and additional operational metrics from X-UI.
- **Version and Start Time Information**: Delivers core version information and confirms whether the core service has
  started
  successfully.
- **Flexible Configuration Options**: Supports customization through environment variables, command-line arguments, and
  YAML configuration files,
  providing maximum flexibility for different deployment scenarios.
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Features Docker images for multiple architectures, including AMD64 and ARM64,
  ensuring compatibility across diverse deployment environments.
- **Enhanced Security**: Offers optional BasicAuth protection for the metrics endpoint, providing an
  additional layer of security for sensitive monitoring data.
- **Seamless Prometheus Integration**: Designed to work flawlessly with Prometheus, enabling straightforward setup and
  configuration for comprehensive X-UI panel monitoring.
- **Comprehensive VPN Monitoring**: Simplifies the monitoring and management of VPN services by providing a rich set of
  metrics,
  significantly improving visibility into system performance and user activity.

### YAML Configuration

You can use a YAML configuration file to configure the exporter by providing the `--config-file` flag. When using a
configuration file, all settings are read from the file and any command-line arguments are ignored. The YAML
configuration file should contain the same parameters as the command-line arguments, but in YAML format.

A sample configuration file `config-example.yaml` is provided with the project, which you can use as a template for your
own configuration. The structure of the YAML file matches the command-line arguments.

Example YAML configuration:

```yaml
# X-UI panel connection details
panel-base-url: "https://your-panel-url"
panel-username: "your-panel-username"
panel-password: "your-panel-password"
insecure-skip-verify: false

# General settings
update-interval: 30
timezone: "UTC"

# Metrics server configuration
metrics-ip: "0.0.0.0"
metrics-port: 9090
clients-bytes-rows: 0
metrics-protected: false
metrics-username: "metricsUser"
metrics-password: "MetricsVeryHardPassword"
```

> **Note:** When using a configuration file with the `--config-file` flag, all settings
> are taken from the configuration file, and any other command-line arguments are ignored.

## Installation

There are several ways to install and run the X-UI Metrics Exporter, each tailored to different environments and
deployment preferences. Select the installation method that aligns best with your infrastructure requirements:

### Automatic Installation Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the exporter is using automatic installation script:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/sedyh/x-ui-exporter/main/install.sh)
```

During installation, you'll be prompted to enter:

1. Your X-UI panel URL
2. Admin username
3. Admin password

> **Note:** The script will validate your credentials to ensure they work with your panel.

After installation, the service will be running automatically. You can manage it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status x-ui-exporter    # Check status
sudo systemctl restart x-ui-exporter   # Restart service
sudo systemctl stop x-ui-exporter      # Stop service
```

### Manual CLI Installation

If you prefer manual installation, download the latest binary from
the [releases page](https://github.com/sedyh/x-ui-exporter/releases) for your architecture.

#### Running with command-line arguments:

```bash
./x-ui-exporter --panel-base-url="https://your-panel-url" \
                --panel-username="your-panel-username" \
                --panel-password="your-panel-password"
```

#### Running with a configuration file:

1. Create a `config.yaml` file based on the example configuration
2. Run the exporter:

```bash
./x-ui-exporter --config-file=config.yaml
```

> **Important:** The configuration file approach and command-line arguments cannot be combined.
> When using a configuration file, any command-line arguments are ignored.

### Docker Installation

Running with Docker provides an optimal solution for containerized environments, offering simplified deployment and
streamlined updates.

#### Using Docker Run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name x-ui-exporter \
  -e PANEL_BASE_URL="https://your-panel-url" \
  -e PANEL_USERNAME="your-panel-username" \
  -e PANEL_PASSWORD="your-panel-password" \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  sedyh/x-ui-exporter
```

#### Using Docker Compose:

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  x-ui-exporter:
    image: sedyh/x-ui-exporter
    container_name: x-ui-exporter
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PANEL_BASE_URL=https://your-panel-url
      - PANEL_USERNAME=your-panel-username
      - PANEL_PASSWORD=your-panel-password
      # Optional settings
      # - METRICS_PORT=9090
      # - UPDATE_INTERVAL=30
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Security Recommendation:** For production deployments, it's strongly advised to enable metrics authentication by
> setting `METRICS_PROTECTED=true` and configuring a secure custom metrics username and password.

### Docker build

You can build the Docker image locally for both AMD and ARM architectures using Docker Buildx:

```bash
docker buildx create --name multiarch-builder --use
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --build-arg GIT_TAG=$(git describe --tags --always) \
  --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  -t <registry_name>:<tag> \
  --push .
```

#### Building for a Single Architecture

To build for a specific architecture only:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t ksusonic/x-ui-exporter:latest .
```

## Integration with Prometheus

To collect metrics with Prometheus, add the exporter to your prometheus.yml configuration file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "x-ui_exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: [ "<exporter-ip>:9090" ]
```

Ensure to replace `<your-panel-url>`, `<your-panel-username>`, `<your-panel-password>`, and `<exporter-ip>`
with your actual information.
